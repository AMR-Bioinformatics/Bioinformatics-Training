_R Programming_

**Introduction**

R is one of the most widely used programmming languages in Bioinformatics. This is because R offeres a variety of statistical tools that are accompanied with great visualizations
such as graphs and charts that are typically used in microbiome or metagenomic analysis. This course aims to give you the basics of R for metagenomics.
This course will be divided into two section:

a) Basic introduction of R- A brief but thorough introduction to the R(packages, data structures), Basic scripting in R and the use of basic functions(%>%)

b) Utilization of R for metagenomics  - (Bioconductor package)


**OBJECTIVES**
By the end of this course you should be able to:-

1. Perform basic analysis in R using different functions in R eg Filter,Sort, removing NA's and mutate
2. Use the Bioconducter package to perform a microbiome analysis
3. Hone your skills to suite any research questions that might need you to use R.


**Assessment**
Because there are only two main objectives you will also have two main assessments, each at the end of each objective.



**Prerequisites**
R is just like any other programming language to master it you must practice! Therefore in this course the expectation is that you should have an _Experimenter's Mindset_

ENJOY!!!
