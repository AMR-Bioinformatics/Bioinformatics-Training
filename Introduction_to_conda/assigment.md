## Your Assignment

1. Using your laptop/computer, Set up a conda environment named **qc**

2. Within this environment, install the packages **fastqc** and **multiqc**

3. Write a markdown file named *conda-qc-commands.md* where you will write down the commands you used to do the previous 2 steps. This markdown file should be placed in your ***Introduction_to_conda*** folder

4. List the packages within your environment and paste the content you see on a well formatted markdown file named *conda-qc-environment.md* which should be appended on your forked repo under the ***Introduction_to_conda*** folder
