## Introduction

Bioinformatics is a rapidly evolving field that combines biology, computer science, and data analysis. This internship training aims to provide hands-on experience and theoretical knowledge in various bioinformatics tools and techniques. By the end of this program, interns will have gained proficiency in analyzing biological data, interpreting results, and using computational tools to address biological research questions.

## Curriculum

The training curriculum covers a diverse range of topics, including:

- Introduction to Slack, Git, and GitHub
- Introduction to UNIX command-line
- Shell scripting
- Introduction to Conda
- QC of raw sequence data and preprocessing (Trimming)
- Genome assembly
- Strain typing
- Database querying (AMR, Virulence)
- Phylogenetic analysis
- Miniproject: Working on reproducing a research article
- Introduction to Python and machine learning for bioinformatics
- Nextflow and Docker
- Introduction to R programming for Visualization
- Soft skills
